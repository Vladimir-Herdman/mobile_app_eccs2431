## Use Notes

In terms of what we have in the repo here, we just wanted to put what we
changed explicitly.  We realize, however, that due to android IDE / Kotlin
theme and package naming qualities, just copy pasting from one file can change
how the app will run, even stopping it, one issue we came across being using
slightly different project names stopping copying and pasting code from working.

To combat this, we have also uploaded in the folder named PizzaPriceCalc/ the entire
working directory for the android project from one of our members, one that had the
app running and working.  Hopefully, that structure can be taken and ran if copy pasting
the changed files does not work.

The .gradle/, build/, .idea/, and local.properties/ folders were also gitignored from the
total upload.
